# Soil Nutrient Prediction for Optimized Maize Yield

## ðŸŒ± Overview
Soil health is fundamental to sustainable agriculture, directly influencing crop yield and food security.  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict the availability of **11 essential soil nutrients** and calculate the **nutrient gaps** required for **maize crops** to achieve a **target yield of 4 tons per hectare**.

The model leverages soil and environmental data collected from farms across Africa (2019 dataset) to provide precise fertilizer and soil management recommendations.

By offering scalable and cost-effective soil analysis, this solution empowers farmers to:
- Optimize fertilizer use
- Improve soil management practices
- Maximize crop yields sustainably

## ðŸ”¬ Key Features
- Predicts availability of key macronutrients (N, P, K) and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, etc.).
- Calculates nutrient gaps to reach the target maize yield.
- Uses real-world soil and environmental data from African farms.
- Supports data-driven, sustainable agriculture practices.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
- **Python** (for model building and analysis)
- **Scikit-learn**, for ML frameworks
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Google Colab** for development and prototyping

## ðŸ“Š Future Improvements
- Deploy the model as an API for real-time nutrient recommendations.
- Expand to other crops and target yields.
- Integrate with satellite or drone data for enhanced environmental features.
